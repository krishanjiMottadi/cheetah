# CHEETAH
Cheetah is a 3D-printed RC race car for on-road usage.

Here, you can find  the sketches required for the ESP32 microcontroller, both for the remote control and the car. Also, you can find the codes required to operate a separate data logger alongside the car, including MATLAB functions to evaluate the recorded data graphically. Furthermore, all files for printing are provided in .stl and .stp formats.

Also, you can find .stp files of the different part groups as well as of the full car assembly, as an aid in assembling the car.
